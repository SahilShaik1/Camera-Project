# Camera-Project

- Example project of connecting to live video streams within the same network through the android application

## How to use

- Once the application has found all IP addresses located within your network, it will run a dropdown menu associated with each IP address
- Once any of the IP Addresses are picked, a new menu appears with any possible information needed to create a connection
- Once all of the information is filled in, the application attempts to setup a connection between your phone and the video stream

## Disclaimer
- Due to the fact that this project is meant to be a proof of concept work, the application is not meant to be used as a product and as a result does not reflect my best work
- In order to modify the video stream displayed, either modify the url variable in the GlobalVars or modify the url string to the desired stream
- Not all video cameras use the same stream format, please ask your video camera manufacturer for its stream format
